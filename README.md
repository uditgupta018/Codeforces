# Codeforces Problems Tutorials 
This repo contains problems solved on Codeforces (competitive programming).
Also to provide tutorials for these problems.

Mainly Focussing on Dynamic Programmings, Tree, Graphs Problems. 
Currently Div2- C.

## Problem Contents - 
### Div 2-C 
* [1) Subsequences](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/597/C) `Dp` `Segnment Tree`
* [2) Journey](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/721/C) `Dp` `Graphs` `Topological Sort`
* [3) Coloring Trees](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/711/C) `Dp`

## Tutorials - 
1) Subsequences - http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/597/C
  - This is DP type problem. Also requires segment trees/BIT. 
  - O(nlogn).			
2) Journey - http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/721/C
  - This is graphs problem with DP.
  - Also requires topological sort concept.
  - O(mn).
